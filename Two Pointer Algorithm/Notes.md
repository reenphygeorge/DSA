# Two Pointer Algorithm

* The two pointer technique is a useful tool to utilize when searching for pairs in a sorted array. 

* This technique can save both time and space complexity.

* If brute force approach takes O(n^2), then by using this method we can solve it in O(n)

* For example we initialize two variables i = 0 and j = n-1, where n is the size of array. Now instead of 2 loops we can do the operations with 1 loop by changing the variable's position depending in the condition.
