# Modulo Arithmetics

<br>

## Note
* In some cases the result which we need can't be stored in any variables. For example factorial of a big number.

* In this case we will be asked to store the answer as the modulo (%) of a given number M.

## Properties

* ( a + b) % c = ( ( a % c ) + ( b % c ) ) % c
* ( a * b) % c = ( ( a % c ) * ( b % c ) ) % c
* ( a – b) % c = ( ( a % c ) – ( b % c ) ) % c
